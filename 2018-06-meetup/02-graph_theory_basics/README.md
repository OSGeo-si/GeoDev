# Graph theory basics and alghoritems overview

__Nejc Dougan__

We will look into basics of graph theory. To make concepts cleare we have prepared small python example how to model a Graph as a python class and apply alghoritems. 
We took a look at three alghoritems:

* Breadth-first-serach
* Depth-first-serach
* Dijsktra's algohitem (shortest path) 

We will also take a look at Operation Research field for optimization problems, and demonstrated how we can solve traveling salse man problem. We will use google's OR-Tools trough python API.
